# Clarifying Questions for Neovim Journaling Plugin

Please answer the following questions inline. Feel free to select multiple options where applicable or provide your own answers.

## 1. File Organization & Structure

**Q1.1: Where should journal entries be stored?**
- a) Single root directory (e.g., `~/journal/`)
- b) Configurable directory path
- c) Multiple directories (separate for daily/weekly/monthly)
- d) Other: _________


Configurable directory path, that defaults to `~/journal/`

- a) Date-based: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `YYYY-Wxx.md`, `YYYY-MM.md`
- b) Custom format (please specify): _________
- c) User configurable

Configurable, but defaults to Date-based

**Q1.3: Should there be a specific directory structure?**
- a) Flat structure (all in one directory)
- b) Hierarchical by year/month (e.g., `2025/01/2025-01-15.md`)
- c) Separate folders for daily/weekly/monthly/inbox
- d) Other: _________

Flat

## 2. Journal Entry Types

**Q2.1: What template should each journal type use?**
- a) Simple blank file
- b) Pre-populated with headers (e.g., ## Goals, ## Notes, ## Reflections)
- c) User-configurable templates
- d) Date/time stamp at the top
- e) Combination of above (please specify): _________

Configurable by template file. The configuration shall point to a file path

**Q2.2: For weekly/monthly journals, how should the date range be determined?**
- a) Week starts on Monday
- b) Week starts on Sunday
- c) User configurable
- d) ISO week numbering

ISO week numbering

## 3. Zettelkasten Functionality

**Q3.1: How should note relationships be represented?**
- a) Using WikiLinks: `[[note-title]]`
- b) Using markdown links: `[Note Title](path/to/note.md)`
- c) Custom ID system (e.g., `202501151430` timestamp-based IDs)
- d) Combination of above

A, B

**Q3.2: What defines a "child", "sibling", or "parent" note?**
- a) Directory hierarchy (child = subfolder, sibling = same folder)
- b) Metadata/frontmatter (YAML front matter with parent ID)
- c) Link-based relationships
- d) Numeric/hierarchical IDs (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1)
- e) Other: _________

In zettelkasten files have a numeric id which starts with a number, then a character, than again a number and so on.
so two files can be
* siblings if one has ID `1a` and the other `1b` (wher)
* parent/child if one has ID `1a` and the other `1a3` (`1a3` is supposed to be the third children of `1a`)

The ID grows as much as needed, in a sequence of number/character/number/character... (e.g. `1b3c5a100z`)


**Q3.3: Should child/sibling/parent notes have automatic naming?**
- a) Yes, auto-generate names based on parent (e.g., `parent-note-1.md`, `parent-note-2.md`)
- b) Yes, prompt user for title
- c) Use timestamp-based IDs
- d) Other: _________

I want the zettelkasten ID (`zid:`) to be in a markdown frontmatter

**Q3.4: Should there be bidirectional linking?**
- a) Yes, automatically create backlinks
- b) No, manual linking only
- c) Optional/configurable

The text files shall only have the `zid`. The linking is supported by Markdown plugins the user alreay installed in neovim, or by this plugin functionalities that via software show the linking between notes (e.g. we can provide a support for Telescope)

## 4. Line Tagging & Referencing

**Q4.1: How should line tags be formatted?**
- a) Inline markers: `This is a line #tag-name ^ref-id`
- b) Markdown links: `[^ref-id]: This is a line`
- c) Custom syntax (please specify): _________

I want to base this feature to the native neovim support to tags (`#some-tag`)
There must be a function that "appends" the tag to the line.
The tag must be a UUID (e.g. like the one generated by uuidgen)
The tag must be conceiled
There must be a function to copy the tag of a line, so that it can be referenced in another page
The copied tag must appear different than the original (same tag code, but somehow different), so that we can differentiate the original tag from the references
The copied tag must be conceiled as well, but in a different way, so that we can always tell which tag is the original and which is a reference to the original

**Q4.2: How should tagged lines be referenced in other documents?**
- a) `[[note-name#ref-id]]` - links to specific line
- b) `[[note-name^ref-id]]` - block reference style
- c) Copy the line content with attribution
- d) Other: _________

See Q4.1 and you must ask all the questions you need to clarify the implementation

**Q4.3: Should there be a way to view all references to a tagged line?**
- a) Yes, show backlinks/references panel
- b) Yes, via command (e.g., `:ZournalShowReferences`)
- c) No, not needed
- d) Other: _________

Via command
